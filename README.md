# Android Remote Server

## Configuration
* Make sure Java is installed and PATH set
  - Test by running the command java -version in the terminal/command prompt
* Make sure both the phone and computer are on the same network

## Installation
* Download the JAR [here](executables/Remotev2.jar?raw=true)

## Steps to run
* Run the JAR file by doubling clicking (on Linux the JAR will need executable permission, run chmod u+x Remotev2.jar)
* If there is trouble running the JAR directly, run the [Remote.bat](executables/Remote.bat?raw=true) file on Windows / [Remote.sh](executables/Remote.sh?raw=true) on Linux
* If the IP is displayed with an error message, it means the computer is not connected to a network
* If there are multiple IP addresses shown then try using either. If it does not work then use the others. Multiple IPs can be shown in case of multiple connections to the network or virtual network cards are installed.
* Enter the IP on the Android Remote phone application
